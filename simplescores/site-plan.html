          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>I want to create a film music database that allows people to find and purchase the music they want from various websites. As film music is often released in different collections, some more complete than others, my plan for this website is to list all official soundtrack releases for a specific film and make it easy to purchase them by linking them to broader websites like Amazon and Walmart or more niche sites like La La Land Records, a record company that releases expanded special editions of film scores to the public in special box sets.</p>  <!-- change this -->
    
    
          <h3>Audience</h3>
          <p>My audience is people who care about film music and want to enjoy them in the most complete way currently possible</p>  <!-- change this -->

            WHY THIS WEBSITE EXISTS	

            The world of film music is complicated and aggravating to people invested in film scores. After a film is composed, the film studio retains the rights to the score, and this can lead to film scores losing the attention and respect they deserve. Film studios will often release an “original soundtrack” at the release of a film, however these releases are often incomplete, with major cues (segments of music) cut out entirely or saved as “bonus tracks” for buying the soundtrack at certain retailers or as a digital album. Thankfully, film studios will often release expanded or complete scores down the line in special editions, released at occasions like anniversaries or sequel releases. However, these are often limited in quantity and/or available dates, released by third-party record labels outside of mainstream retailers, or poorly advertised, leading to confusion for the average family member or friend wanting to purchase a gift for their music loving loved one. This website aims to help fix that.
            
            HOW IT WORKS
            
            The goal of this website is to present any given film’s released score in a way that allows fans of film music to find the releases they want. Whether that be options to purchase them from retailers providing them, or the information needed to find out-of-print releases second-hand, this website aims to provide those resources.
            
            Each film will have its own page where each release’s information will be listed along with links (if available) to retailers to purchase them. If a release is out-of-print, links to second-hand markets such as eBay, OfferUp, and Craigslist will be provided where those releases might be able to be found.

          <h3>Q&A</h3>
          <p>
            WHAT INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE?

            Every known detail of each soundtrack release will be listed on the film’s page, from album titles and covers, release dates, tracklists, formats (such as digital, cd and vinyl), total track lengths, current mainstream availability, everything you need to know to compare and contrast any given film’s music releases and find the ones you want.
            
            WHAT ABOUT TV SERIES?
            
            TV series will be listed too! Music wise, they’re identical to films and carry the same love from the same music-loving people. The only major difference is there are often multiple separate releases for a single series, grouped by season or episodes, requiring multiple soundtracks to complete the series collection. These groupings will be noted on the page for the entire series instead of each season or group of episodes getting split into its own page to avoid creating unnecessary confusion.
            
            WHAT ABOUT “BONUS TRACKS”?
            
            Nearly identical releases simply containing a handful of “Bonus Tracks” will be listed on their own on the film’s page and treated as their own releases. Though the album titles, covers, and release dates may be identical, the emphasis of this website is on the contents of any given score release, and any differences between individual retailers will be considered completely separate from the default release.
            
            WHAT IF THE FILM I’M LOOKING FOR ISN’T LISTED?
            
            Contact me! Feel free to send a film request to the email in the contact page and I’ll do what I can to find the information I can and provide it here.
            
            WHAT IF I FIND AN ERROR IN A FILM’S SCORE LISTING?
            
            Contact me! I’m a human and make mistakes, and as I’ve mentioned sometimes this kind of information can be incredibly difficult to find, hence the reason I wanted to start this website in the first place. Feel free to send an email to [contact email] with any information you have to help me update the website faster, such as retail listings, news articles, composer blogs, anything you think would be helpful.
