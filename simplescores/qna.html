                <p class="title-text">WHAT INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE?</p>
                <p>Every known detail of each soundtrack release will be listed on the film’s page, from album titles and covers, release dates, tracklists, formats (such as digital, cd and vinyl), total track lengths, current mainstream availability, everything you need to know to compare and contrast any given film’s music releases and find the ones you want.</p>
                <p class="title-text">WHAT ABOUT TV SERIES?
                </p>
                <p>TV series will be listed too! Music wise, they’re identical to films and carry the same love from the same music-loving people. The only major difference is there are often multiple separate releases for a single series, grouped by season or episodes, requiring multiple soundtracks to complete the series collection. These groupings will be noted on the page for the entire series instead of each season or group of episodes getting split into its own page to avoid creating unnecessary confusion.</p>
                <p>WHAT ABOUT “BONUS TRACKS”?</p>
                <p>Nearly identical releases simply containing a handful of “Bonus Tracks” will be listed on their own on the film’s page and treated as their own releases. Though the album titles, covers, and release dates may be identical, the emphasis of this website is on the contents of any given score release, and any differences between individual retailers will be considered completely separate from the default release.</p>
                <p class="title-text">WHAT IF THE FILM I’M LOOKING FOR ISN’T LISTED?</p>
                <p>Contact me! Feel free to send a film request to the email in the contact page and I’ll do what I can to find the information I can and provide it here.</p>
                <p class="title-text">WHAT IF I FIND AN ERROR IN A FILM’S SCORE LISTING?</p>
                <p>Contact me! I’m a human and make mistakes, and as I’ve mentioned sometimes this kind of information can be incredibly difficult to find, hence the reason I wanted to start this website in the first place. Feel free to send an email to [contact email] with any information you have to help me update the website faster, such as retail listings, news articles, composer blogs, anything you think would be helpful.</p>
